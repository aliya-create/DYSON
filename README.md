# Dyson: Good Product or Great Marketing?

This mini case study looks at one question: **are Dyson’s vacuums and hair tools truly worth the premium, or did the marketing team just nail the story?**

- Dyson products are strong, but not magically better than every rival.  
- The real moat is **branding, design, and “status appliance” feeling**, not only specs.  
- Smart marketing makes people okay with a 2–3x price gap, even when reviews mention issues.

# What I Did

- Reviewed real customer opinions and ratings for Dyson and key competitors.  
- Grouped feedback into themes: performance, design, ease of use, reliability, price.  
- Turned it into a simple dashboard + story that a marketing or product team can use.

# What Stood Out

- **Love:** powerful, sleek design, “fun to use”, feels premium at home.  
- **Meh:** other brands now reach “good enough” performance for much less money.  
- **Pain:** worries about battery life, repairs, and “for this price, it should last longer”.

# My Take as a Strategist

Dyson wins by selling a **feeling**: status, taste, and tech‑luxury in everyday life.  
Marketing focuses on hero moments and beautiful experiences that make the price feel justified.
